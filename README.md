# advent-of-code-2023

Advent of Code repository using Python.

## Project Structure

Each day's puzzle lives under the corresponding numeric directory `NN/`

Each directory will contain:
- `day_NN.py` (the solution)
- `test_day_NN.py` (the tests)
- `input.txt` (puzzle input from the Advent of Code site)
