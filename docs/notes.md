### How to Participate in Advent of Code

In general, you’ll follow a series of steps to solve a puzzle on the site:

  1. Log in on the Advent of Code website. You do this by using your credentials from another service like GitHub, Google, Twitter, or Reddit.
  2. Read the puzzle text and pay special attention to the given example. You should make sure you understand the solution for the example data.
  3. Download your personalized input for the puzzle. You’ll need this input to find your unique answer to the problem.
  4. Code up your solution. This is the fun part, which you’ll get a lot of practice for in the rest of this tutorial.
  5. Enter your answer to the puzzle on the puzzle page. If your answer is correct, then you earn a gold star, and part two of the puzzle opens up.
  6. Repeat steps 2 and 4 for part two of the puzzle. This second part is similar to the first, but it usually adds a twist requiring you to adapt your code.
  7. Enter your second answer on the puzzle page to earn your second star and finish the puzzle.
